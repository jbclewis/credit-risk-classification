# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge

Various techniques were used to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company, a model was built that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Overview of the Analysis

* The purpose of this analysis is to create a model that can predit the creditworthiness of borrowers. 
* A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company was used. 
* The dependent variable (y value) in this analysis is the loan status showing if a loan is healthy or at risk and the independent variables (x values) are loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts and derogatory marks.
* I first split the data into traning and testing sets, then, define our dependent and independent variables and create logistic regression model and fit our original data to this model. A trained model is used to make predictions so we can evaluate the model`s performance.

## Results

* The logistic regression model predicts a healthy loan at 100% precision.
* A high-risk loan is predicted at 87% precision.

## Summary

* The logistic regression model for predicting a healthy loan is the recommended model.
